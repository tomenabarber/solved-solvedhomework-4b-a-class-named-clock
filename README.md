Before attempting this project, be sure you have completed all of the reading assignments, hands-on labs, discussions, and assignments to date. (25 points) Design a class named Clock. You should use your IDE for this exercise. The class contains private data fields for startTime and stopTime, a no argument constructor that initializes the startTime to the current time, a method named start() that resets the startTime to the given time, a stop() method that sets the endTime to the given time and a getElapsedTime() method that returns the elapsed time in seconds. Create a TestClock class to construct a Clock instance and return the elapsed time. Command line arguments should be used to send the start and end times. You should use the java.time classes. Here is sample run: java TestClock 11:45:12 11:48:13 Elapsed time in seconds is: 18
